 #### A Decentralized Token Exchange using 0xBTC as a base pair

Most decentralized exchanges previous to 2018 use Ether as a base pair.  This is natural because Ether is the lifeblood of the Ethereum network.  However, in reality , the Ethereum team does not want Ether to be used as a currency.  Ether is not a token and it was never designed to be used as a payment mechanism.  The primary goal of Ether is to keep the Ethereum network secure as stated by the Ethereum Development team.  Therefore Ether may radically change if it means that it will improve the health of the nework. In order to provide the Ethereum community with a more stable solution, a token called 0xBTC was created by the community which is mined using proof of work exactly like Ether.  

0xBTC token is built from the ground-up to be a payment mechanism.  It is distributed using decentralized proof of work exactly like Bitcoin and Ether.  It serves as the perfect second base pair for Ethereum Decentralized Exchanges and is the most well-equipped currency to use on token-only exchanges since it is Bitcoin which lives inside of Ethereum.   

This decentralized exchange is forked from ForkDelta and will allow the exchange of any RC20 token for 0xBTC and vice versa.  It uses a market maker/market taker order book architecture.
