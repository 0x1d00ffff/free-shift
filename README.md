 #### A Decentralized Token Exchange using 0xBTC as a base pair

Most decentralized exchanges previous to 2018 use Ether as a base pair.  This does make sense since Ether is the lifeblood of the Ethereum network.  However, Ether is not a token and it is not meant to be used as a currency.  The primary goal of Ether is to keep the Ethereum network secure as stated by the Ethereum Development team.  In order to provide the Ethereum community with a solution, a token called 0xBTC was created by the community which is mined using proof of work exactly like Ether.  

0xBTC token is built from the ground-up to be a payment mechanism and nothing else.  It is distributed using decentralized proof of work exactly like Bitcoin and Ether.  Thus, it serves as the perfect second base pair for Ethereum Decentralized Exchanges and is the most well-equipped currency to use on token-only exchanges since it is Bitcoin which lives inside of Ethereum.
